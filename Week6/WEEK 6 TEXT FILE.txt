1]Read Python.txt file and Print it in Reverse.
file="C:\\22bca109\\python\\sqlite3\python.txt"
with open(file,"r")as text_file:
    data=text_file.read()
reverse=data[::-1]
print(reverse)


2] Read Python.txt file and Print total number of lines and words in it.
number_words=0
with open("c:\\22bca109\\python\\sqlite3\\python.txt","r") as file:
    for line in file:
        words=line.split()
        number_words+=len(words)
with open("c:\\22bca109\\python\\sqlite3\\python.txt","r") as file:
    lines=file.readlines()
total_lines=len(lines)
print("Total number of lines:",total_lines)
print("Total number of words:",number_words)


3] Read Python.txt file and Print unique word with its count.
unique_words_count=0
with open("c:\\22bca109\\python\\sqlite3\\python.txt","r") as file:
        line=file.read()
        words=set(line.split())
print("total unique words:",len(words))
print("Unqiue words are:",words)


4]Read Python.txt file and Print largest and smallest word from it.
with open("c:\\22bca109\\python\\sqlite3\\python.txt","r") as file:
        line=file.read()
        words=line.split()
        largest=small=words[0]
        for i in range(0,len(words)):
            if (len(largest)<len(words[i])):
                largest=words[i]
            elif(len(small)>len(words[i])):
                  small=words[i]
print("largest word:",largest)
print("smallest word:",small)


5] Read Python.txt file. Convert it into upper case and write into another file "Python_Upper.txt"
f1=open('C:\\22bca109\python\\sqlite3\python_upper.txt','w',newline='')
with open('C:\\2bca109\\python\\sqlite3\\python.txt','r') as file:
    print("Python.txt file in UPPER CASE:-\n")
    for lines in file:
        f1.write(lines.upper())
f1.close()
with open('C:\\22bca109\\python\\sqlite3\\python_upper.txt','r') as f:
    read_txt=f.read()
    print(read_txt)
